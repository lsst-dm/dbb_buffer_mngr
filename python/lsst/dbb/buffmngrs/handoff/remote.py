    """Command transferring files between handoff and endpoint sites.

    To make file transfers look like atomic operations, files are not placed
    in directly in the buffer, but are initially transferred to a separate
    location on the endpoint site, a staging area.  Once the transfer of a
    file is finished, it is moved to the buffer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        Configuration of the endpoint where files should be transferred to.
    awaiting : queue.Queue
        Files that need to be transferred.
    completed : queue.Queue
        Files that were transferred successfully.
    chunk_size : int, optional
        Number of files to process in a single iteration of the transfer
        loop, defaults to 1.
    timeout : int, optional
        Time (in seconds) after which the child process executing a bash
        command will be terminated. If None (default), the command will wait
        indefinitely for the child process to complete.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If endpoint's specification is invalid.
